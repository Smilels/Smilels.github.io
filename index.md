# About Me
I am a postdoc in computer science at [Universit√§t Hamburg](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/people/cong/). In 2014, I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in **Mechatronic Engineering** from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). After that I began my postgraduate research at [The State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems](http://en.hit.edu.cn/post/detail/3602). Since then I focused my research on **Artificial Intelligence and Robotics**. In 2017, I became a Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Prof. Jianwei Zhang](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/people/zhang/), and successfully got my degree on Jan. 2022. I enjoy all the mathematics derivation and programing process in machine learning. Welcome to my research blogs [here](blog) and feel free to discuss with me.
